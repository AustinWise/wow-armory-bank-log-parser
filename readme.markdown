# Wow Armory Bank Parser
This consists of two programs: the first downloads the bank log from [wowarmory.com](http://wowarmory.com) while the second parses the logs and lets you do some querying.
Currently these programs are not very user friendly as the settings are hard coded.  Also, the downloader has not been updated since Blizzard switched to using battle.net account for log-in, so it probably does not work.


## Dependencies
The downloader application uses [my Austin library](http://github.com/AustinWise/austin/).
